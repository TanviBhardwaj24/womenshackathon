For a ${profile.personalInfo.age}-year-old, that's a solid foundation!\n\n${

        : "I'd love to see you get started with a 401(k) if your employer offers one — the tax advantages are huge."

        : "Opening a Roth IRA should be your first move. Tax-free growth is incredible at your age."
    }\n\n**2. Consider index funds** — If you're not already invested in broad market index funds (like VTI or VXUS), they're a fantastic low-cost way to build wealth. Simple, diversified, and historically strong returns.\n\n**3. Build your emergency fund** — Financial planners typically recommend 3-6 months of expenses. Living in San Francisco, I'd lean toward 6 months given the higher cost of living.\n\n${
      profile.debts.length > 0
        ? `**4. Tackle that debt strategically** — With your ${profile.debts[0].type.toLowerCase()} at ${profile.debts[0].interestRate}%, you could consider paying a bit extra each month while still investing. It's a balance, but getting debt-free sooner gives you so much more flexibility.`

At ${profile.personalInfo.age}, you're in a fantastic position because time is your biggest asset.\n\n**The power of compound growth** — If you consistently invest and let your money grow, here's the exciting part: even modest contributions now can grow significantly by the time you're 60-65.\n\n**What I'd focus on:**\n- Make sure you're getting your full employer 401(k) match (that's an immediate 100% return!)\n- Try to max out your Roth IRA annually ($7,000/year)\n- Consider increasing your 401(k) contributions by 1% each year\n\n${

You could keep making regular payments while investing the difference in your Roth IRA or brokerage, where you'd likely earn more than ${profile.debts[0].interestRate}% over time.\n\n2. **The peace-of-mind approach** — If that debt is stressing you out, there's real value in paying it off faster. You could add an extra $500-1000/month from your income and be done in about ${Math.ceil(profile.debts[0].remainingBalance / 1000)} months.\n\n3. **Check for refinancing** — Depending on your credit score, you might be able to refinance to an even lower rate.\n\nPersonally? I'd lean toward a hybrid approach — pay a little extra on the loans while still investing. But go with what lets you sleep best at night!`
